Overview: My fourth project I was tasked with in creating a paper trade stock simulator.

Functionality: Only the share selection, stock graph and share price generation work in the 1-page simulator. Still trying to work out contact form email connection. The 2-page simulator functions on the other hand include what 1-page offers, with the addition of successfully adding shares and selling shares of the second page 'portfolio'

Technologies used: Html, Css, Django, python, SQL, Plotly, Yfinance

Ideas for future improvement:
- less burnout
- Deliver a full functioning web app
- neat code (css didn't work halfway through, so I had to manually input style code)
